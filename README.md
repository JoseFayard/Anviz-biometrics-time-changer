# Anviz-biometrics-time-changer
This is a project that I did with the help of <a href="https://github.com/LuisBrito19A" target="_blank">@LuisBrito19A</a>. The idea was to automatically change the hour of a biometric in the company that we're working on. It's a simple program, but it's useful.

The program uses *Anviz.SDK 2.0.9* nuget package & was built with *.NetCore App 3.1*
